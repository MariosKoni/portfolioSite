# portfolioSite
This is portfolio site that I'm trying to build. It's effectively a test (now) with the inspiration of going online.
I'm by no means an expert and front-end isn't what I like but I'm building in order to learn and to help my sister with her Photography career.

I'm building it in HTML/CSS without any frameworks (for now at least) and with the intention to add some PHP scripts.
Everything is beta bound to change. So this is the starting point effectively.
